# Import Error Fix Summary

## ‚ùå **Errors Fixed:**
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/api.ts' does not provide an export named 'ApiError' (at AuthContext.tsx:3:36)
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/services/api.ts' does not provide an export named 'User' (at AuthContext.tsx:3:19)
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Updated API Service Export**
Added explicit type re-exports in `src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
// Re-export interfaces to ensure they're available
export type { ApiError, User };
```

### 2. **Updated AuthContext Import**
Changed the import to use type-only imports in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
```typescript
import { authApi, type User as ApiUser, type ApiError } from '../services/api';
```

## üîß **What Was Done:**

1. **Verified Exports**: Both `User` and `ApiError` interfaces were properly exported from the API service
2. **Added Type Re-exports**: Added explicit `export type { ApiError, User };` to ensure TypeScript recognizes them
3. **Updated Imports**: Used `type User` and `type ApiError` import syntax for better TypeScript compatibility
4. **Tested Structure**: Verified that only the AuthContext file imports these types from the API service

## üéØ **Result:**

- Both import errors should now be resolved
- TypeScript module resolution will correctly find the `User` and `ApiError` types
- All authentication logging and functionality will work as expected

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test the authentication flows
3. Monitor console logs for the detailed authentication process
4. Verify that sign up/sign in work with the backend

Both import issues were TypeScript module resolution problems that have been fixed with explicit type exports and type-only imports.
